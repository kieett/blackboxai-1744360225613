### Draft Plan for Enhancements

1. **Payment Functionality**:
   - Review and enhance the payment process in `checkout.php`.
   - Ensure that payment status is updated correctly in the database.

2. **Product Details**:
   - Ensure that `product.php` displays all necessary product details, including images, descriptions, and related products.
   - Verify that the product listing in `search.php` is functional.

3. **User Registration/Login**:
   - Review `login.php` and `register.php` for any necessary enhancements or bug fixes.
   - Ensure that redirects to the login page are functioning correctly in `checkout.php`, `cart.php`, and other relevant files.
